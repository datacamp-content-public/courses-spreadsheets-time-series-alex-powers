Hello fellow DataCamp-ers! My name is Alex Powers and this is Time Series Analysis with Spreadsheets. Now, whether you are an aspiring data scientist or a season pro - there is one guarantee in your journey... SPREADSHEETS! There is simply no getting away from this popular tool, so we should probably spend our time (see what I did there) learning how to leverage these tools to provide valuable insights using time series data.

Now when we talk about time series analysis we are talking about the evaluation of results over a frequency based period - daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and so on. This evaluation allows us to answer important questions such as - are we growing? are we decreasing? is there a trend? or perhaps seasonality in our results? These types of questions can present great insights for any medium or business.

First, let's get some of the basic spreadsheet foundations out of the way so we have a clear understanding of how date and time values are stored in spreadsheets.

## Spreadsheet Data Types

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "0626fd42e8"
```

`@part1`
1. Text, `"Spreadsheets are fun!"`

1. Number, `100.56`

1. Boolean, `TRUE`

1. Error Codes, `#NAME?`


`@part2`



`@script`
Spreadsheets most commonly support text, stored in double quotes as opposed to an apostrophe most commonly found in programming languages. Number, stored as a decimal value. Boolean - our TRUE or FALSE values and Error codes which raise a system message when an error occurs - in this example #NAME? references an unknown function.

Ironically, I didn't mention dates or time in what is a time series course. That is because Dates and Times are actually stored as numbers - and custom formatting within the spreadsheet application transform these values to be more readable for the end user.
